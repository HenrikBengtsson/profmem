Package: profmem
================

Version: 0.5.0 [2018-01-30]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Nested profmem() calls are now supported, such that inner profmem() calls
   will not affect outer ones.  This allows, for instance, a package to use
   profmem internally without having to worry about profmem already being
   active when its functions are called.

NEW FEATURES:
 
 o Added profmem_begin() and profmem_end() as an alternative to profmem().

 o Added profmem_suspend() and profmem_resume() for suspending and resuming
   an active profmem session.

 o Added profmem_status() for checking whether profmem is inactive, active, or
   suspended.
   
 o Added profmem_depth() to get the current depth of nested profmem sessions. 

 o print() for Rprofmem now reports on the threshold used, if known.

 o print() for Rprofmem gained arguments 'expr = TRUE' and 'newpage = FALSE',
   controlling whether the profiled R expression and 'new page' entries should
   be displayed or not.

 o Added option 'future.threshold' for controlling the default threshold level
   for profmem() and profmem_begin().

DOCUMENTATION:

 o VIGNETTE: Updated the example in Section 'An example where memory profiling
   can make a difference' due to improvements in R (>= 3.4.0), which made the
   previous example no longer valid.

 o help("profmem") how provide much more details previously only available
   in the vignette.

BUG FIX:

 o readRprofmem() failed to "workaround" another buggy Rprofmem() output.
