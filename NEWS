Package: profmem
================

Version: 0.6.0 [2020-12-13]

NEW FEATURES:

 * The defaults of arguments 'expr' and 'newpage' of print() for Rprofmem can
   now be set via options 'profmem.print.expr' and 'profmem.print.newpage'.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added documentation on what an 'Rprofmem' data.frame contains.

 * Added example for readRprofmem().

CONSISTENCY:

 * The 'bytes' column returned by readRprofmem() would be of type integer when
   zero allocation events where read, whereas otherwise it would be of type
   numeric.

 * print(x) for Rprofmem now uses an explicit stringsAsFactors=FALSE when
   internally coercing 'x' to a data frame.


Version: 0.5.0 [2018-01-30]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Nested profmem() calls are now supported, such that inner profmem() calls
   will not affect outer ones.  This allows, for instance, a package to use
   profmem internally without having to worry about profmem already being
   active when its functions are called.

NEW FEATURES:
 
 * Added profmem_begin() and profmem_end() as an alternative to profmem().

 * Added profmem_suspend() and profmem_resume() for suspending and resuming
   an active profmem session.

 * Added profmem_status() for checking whether profmem is inactive, active, or
   suspended.
   
 * Added profmem_depth() to get the current depth of nested profmem sessions. 

 * print() for Rprofmem now reports on the threshold used, if known.

 * print() for Rprofmem gained arguments 'expr = TRUE' and 'newpage = FALSE',
   controlling whether the profiled R expression and 'new page' entries should
   be displayed or not.

 * Added option 'profmem.threshold' for controlling the default threshold level
   for profmem() and profmem_begin().

DOCUMENTATION:

 * VIGNETTE: Updated the example in Section 'An example where memory profiling
   can make a difference' due to improvements in R (>= 3.4.0), which made the
   previous example no longer valid.

 * help("profmem") how provide much more details previously only available
   in the vignette.

BUG FIX:

 * readRprofmem() failed to "workaround" another buggy Rprofmem() output.
